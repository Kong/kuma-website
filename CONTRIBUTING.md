Hello, and welcome! Whether you are looking for help, trying to report a bug,
thinking about getting involved in the project or about to submit a patch, this
document is for you! Its intent is to be both an entry point for newcomers to
the community (with various technical backgrounds), and a guide/reference for
contributors and maintainers.

## Where to seek help?

community and the maintainers of this project. If you do not have an
existing account, please follow this [link](https://chat.kuma.io) to sign

**Please avoid opening GitHub issues for general questions or help**, as those
should be reserved for actual bug reports. The Kuma community is welcoming and
more than willing to assist you on Slack!

## Where to report bugs?

Feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma-website/issues/new/choose) on
the GitHub repository, we would be grateful to hear about it! Please be provide a direct link to the webpage that contains the issue.

If you wish, you are more than welcome to propose a patch to fix the issue!

on how to best do so.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions of all kinds, you do not need to code to be helpful!
All of the following tasks are noble and worthy contributions that you can make without coding:

- Reporting a bug (see the [report bugs](#where-to-report-bugs) section)
- Helping other members of the community on Slack
- Fixing a typo in the documentation
- Providing your feedback on the proposed features and designs
- Reviewing Pull Requests

If you wish to contribute code (features or bug fixes), see the [Submitting a patch](#submitting-a-patch) section.

### Submitting a patch

Feel free to contribute, we love to receive Pull
Requests! If you have any questions throughout the process, come chat with us first on [Slack](#where-to-seek-for-help)!

When contributing, please follow the guidelines in this document and [WRITING-DOCUMENTATION.md](WRITING-DOCUMENTATION.md).
They will cover topics such as the different Git branches we use, the commit message
format to use or the appropriate code style.

Once you have read them, and you are ready to submit your Pull Request, be sure
to verify a few things:

- We do trunk based development so the only valid branch to open a PR against is `master`.
- Your commit history is clean: changes are atomic and the git message format
  was respected
- Rebase your work on top of the base branch (seek help online on how to use
  `git rebase`; this is important to ensure your commit history is clean and
   linear)

If the above guidelines are respected, your Pull Request will be reviewed by
a maintainer. And if you are asked to update your patch by a reviewer, please do so!

If your Pull Request was accepted and fixes a bug, adds functionality, or
makes it significantly easier to use or understand Kuma's website, congratulations!
You are now an official contributor to Kuma. Get in touch with us to receive
your very own [Contributor T-shirt](#contributor-t-shirt)!
