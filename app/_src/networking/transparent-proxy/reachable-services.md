When the transparent proxy is enabled, {{ Kuma }} automatically configures each data plane proxy to connect with every other data plane proxy in the same mesh. This setup ensures broad service-to-service communication but can create issues in large service meshes:

- **Increased Memory Usage**: The configuration for each data plane proxy can consume significant memory as the mesh grows.
- **Slower Propagation**: Even small configuration changes for one service must be propagated to all data planes, which can be slow and resource-intensive.
- **Excessive Traffic**: Frequent updates generate additional traffic between the control plane and data plane proxies, especially when services are added or changed often.

In real-world scenarios, services usually need to communicate only with a few other services rather than all services in the mesh. To address these challenges, {{ Kuma }} offers the **Reachable Services** feature, allowing you to define only the services that each proxy should connect to. Specifying reachable services helps reduce memory usage, improves configuration propagation speed, and minimizes unnecessary traffic.

Here’s how to configure reachable services:

{% tabs reachable-services useUrlFragment=false %}
{% tab reachable-services Kubernetes %}
Specify the list of reachable services in the `kuma.io/transparent-proxying-reachable-services` annotation, separating each service with a comma. Your workload configuration could look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: demo-client
  annotations:
    kuma.io/transparent-proxying-reachable-services: "redis_kuma-demo_svc_6379,elastic_kuma-demo_svc_9200"
...
```

You can update your workload manifests manually or use a command like:

```sh
kumactl annotate pods example-app \
  "kuma.io/transparent-proxying-reachable-services=redis_kuma-demo_svc_6379,elastic_kuma-demo_svc_9200"
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab reachable-services Universal %}
To specify reachable services in your `Dataplane` resource, add them under the `networking.transparentProxying.reachableServices` path. Here’s an example:

```yaml
type: Dataplane
mesh: default
name: {% raw %}{{ name }}{% endraw %}
networking:
  address: {% raw %}{{ address }}{% endraw %}
  inbound:
    - port: {% raw %}{{ port }}{% endraw %}
      tags:
        kuma.io/service: demo-client
  transparentProxying:
    redirectPortInbound: {{ tproxy.defaults.redirect.inbound.port }}
    redirectPortOutbound: {{ tproxy.defaults.redirect.outbound.port }}
    reachableServices:
      - redis_kuma-demo_svc_6379
      - elastic_kuma-demo_svc_9200 
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

This configuration ensures that `example-app` only connects to `redis_kuma-demo_svc_6379` and `elastic_kuma-demo_svc_9200`, reducing the overhead associated with managing connections to all services in the mesh.
