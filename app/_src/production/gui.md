title: Kuma user interface (GUI)
content_type: explanation
---

{{site.mesh_product_name}} now ships with a basic web-based GUI that will serve as a visual overview of your dataplanes, meshes, and various traffic policies.

{% tip %}
The GUI pairs with the HTTP API â€” Read more about the HTTP API [here](/docs/{{ page.release }}/reference/http-api)
{% endtip %}

When launching {{site.mesh_product_name}}, the GUI will start by default on the API port, and defaults to `:5681/gui`. You can access it in your web browser by going to `http://localhost:5681/gui`.

## Overview
This is a general overview of all of the meshes and zones found. You can then view each entity and see how many dataplanes and traffic permissions, routes, and logs are associated with that mesh.

If you click on an inbound or outbound you can get extra information including detailed envoy stats and configuration.
This can be useful to understand what policies are modifying configuration or when troubleshooting an issue.
