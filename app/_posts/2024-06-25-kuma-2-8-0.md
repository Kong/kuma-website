Weâ€™re excited to announce the release of Kuma 2.8, featuring new and exciting capabilities such as `MeshExternalService`, `MeshPassthrough` policy, along with numerous improvements and groundwork for future developments.

# Notable features
* A new `MeshExternalService` resource that overcomes existing issues with the `ExternalService` resource.
* A new `MeshPassthrough` policy that allows exposing external endpoints for rich clients through the mesh and support for wildcard domains.
* HostnameGenerator provides a way to generate custom domains for your `MeshExternalServices`, offering enhanced security.

Feel free to check our [release notes](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma/releases/tag/2.8.0) for the full list of changes.

## HostnameGenerator

It's a brand new resource [`HostnameGenerator`](/docs/2.8.x/networking/hostnamegenerator) that enables you to generate custom domain for your `MeshExternalService`. By default Kuma is generating a domain for your `ExternalService` by adding suffix `.mesh` to the name of your `ExternalService`. With this release, you now have control over the domain.

Let's take a look at this example:

```yaml
apiVersion: kuma.io/v1alpha1
kind: HostnameGenerator
metadata:
  name: example
  namespace: kuma-system
  labels:
    kuma.io/mesh: default
spec:
  selector:
    meshExternalService:
      matchLabels:
        kuma.io/origin: zone
  template: "{{ .DisplayName }}.svc.meshext.local"
```

and now let's create a `MeshExternalService`

```yaml
apiVersion: kuma.io/v1alpha1
kind: MeshExternalService
metadata:
  name: mes-http
  namespace: kuma-system
  labels:
    kuma.io/mesh: default
spec:
  match:
    type: HostnameGenerator
    port: 80
    protocol: http
  endpoints:
  - address: httpbin.org
    port: 80
```

In a brand new tab in the GUI, we can now see the generated domain address for our new `MeshExternalService`.

## MeshExternalService
The `ExternalService` resource struggled with various issues, leading us to develop the more powerful [`MeshExternalService`](/docs/2.8.x/networking/meshexternalservice/) resource. This brand-new resource enables you to add external endpoints to your mesh and overcome the limitations of the `ExternalService`. `MeshExternalService` will eventually replace `ExternalService` and is currently in the alpha phase.

Additionally, you can see status information about the hostname and address of the `MeshExternalService`.

## MeshPasssthrough

Some of the issues with `ExternalService` didn't align with the new design of `MeshExternalService`. As a result, we've introduced a new policy called [`MeshPassthrough`](https://kuma.io/docs/2.8.x/policies/meshpassthrough). This policy facilitates communication with external endpoints for rich clients and offers the flexibility to enable or disable [passthrough mode](/docs/2.8.x/networking/non-mesh-traffic/#outgoing) for individual sidecars. Learn more about passthrough mode.

## Upgrading

We strongly suggest upgrading to Kuma 2.8.0. Upgrading is easy through `kumactl` or Helm.

Be sure to carefully read the [upgrade Guide](/docs/2.8.x/production/upgrades-tuning/upgrades/) and the [version specific upgrade notes](/docs/2.8.x/production/upgrades-tuning/upgrade-notes) before upgrading Kuma.
