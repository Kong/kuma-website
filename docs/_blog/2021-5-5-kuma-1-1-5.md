We are happy to announce a new release of Kuma that ships with an important installation change, as well as improvements to the product.

## Features

- ⚠️ We have updated all the installation scripts to a new location to move away from Bintray, sincer Bintray is shutting down. This may require updating the location of the Kuma distributons in any automation script that has been built around the old Bintray locations.
- Improvements in transparent proxying and in the GUI.
- Kuma is now always setting the locality in multi-zone deployments.

For a complete list of features and updates, take a look at the [full changelog](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
