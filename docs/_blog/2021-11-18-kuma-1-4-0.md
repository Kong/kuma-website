We are happy to announce a new release of Kuma! Kuma 1.4.0 ships with many new features, performance improvements, and bug fixes. We strongly suggest to upgrade, in order to take advantage of the latest and greatest when it comes to service mesh.

With this release, in addition to feature development, we have increased our efforts to benchmark and improve upon scalability and performance. In particular, our focus has been on scaling up large mesh deployments. In this release we have made improvements to the underlying concurrency model and control plane communication to increase scalability. Users are coming to rely upon Kuma to connect orders of magnitude more services. Our goal is to support arbitrarily large meshes with reasonable horizontal scaling of the control plane.

## Features

* ðŸš€ API server authentication now requires user tokens, instead of client certificates.
* ðŸš€ Issue with race condition for permissive mTLS is fixed.
* ðŸš€ Locality-aware load balancing is now supported for external services.
* ðŸš€ HTTP tracing is now available, with thanks to [@sudeeptoroy](https://github.com/sudeeptoroy).
* You can now disable default DNS hosts.
* Performance continues to be significantly improved.
* The Kubernetes controller runtime is upgraded to the most recent version, v1.17.

And much more! The full changelog is available [here](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Join us on the community call!

The community channels are useful to get up and running with Kuma, as well as to learn how to contribute to and discuss the project roadmap. Kuma is a CNCF Sandbox project: neutral, open and inclusive.

The next community call will be hosted on [December 8th at 8:30am PDT](https://kuma.io/community/). Also donâ€™t forget to follow Kuma [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/kumamesh) and star it [on GitHub](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma)!

## Upgrading

Note that user token authentication is required for remote (not localhost) access for the API server. See [the documentation](/docs/docs/latest/security/api-server-auth/) for details.

Be sure to carefully read the [Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma/blob/master/UPGRADE.md) before upgrading Kuma.
