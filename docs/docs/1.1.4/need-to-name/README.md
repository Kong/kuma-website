# Directory formerly known as documentation

This directory is now mean to contain content for a single section of the sidebar nav. This content explains the details of a Kuma implementation -- your writer is having a bit of trouble naming this directory/top-level nav section, so for now we have a README.

TODO:

- rename directory appropriately
- include appropriate files only
- remove this file (the current file)
- directory name possibility: "Components"?
