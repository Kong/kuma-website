# Quickstart in Kubernetes Mode

Congratulations! Now that you have [installed](/install) Kuma, you can get up and running with a few easy steps.

:::tip
Kuma can run in both **Kubernetes** (Containers) and **Universal** mode (for VMs and Bare Metal). You are now looking at the quickstart for Kubernetes mode, but you can also check out the [Universal one](/docs/0.4.0/quickstart/universal).

In order to simulate a real-world scenario, we have built a simple demo application that resembles a marketplace. In this tutorial we will:

* [1. Run the Marketplace application](#)
* [2. Enable Mutual TLS and Traffic Permissions](#)
* [3. Visualize Traffic Metrics](#)

### 1. Run the Marketplace application



### 2. Enable Mutual TLS and Traffic Permissions
