## Quickstart

## Dependencies

Kuma is one single executable that can be installed anywhere, hence why it's both universal and simple to deploy. 

* Running on **Kubernetes**: No dependencies required, since it leverages the underlying K8s API server to store its configuration.

* Running on **Linux**: Kuma requires a PostgreSQL database as a dependency in order to store its configuration. PostgreSQL is a very popular and easy database. You can run Kuma with any managed PostgreSQL offering as well, like AWS RDS or Aurora. Out of sight, out of mind!

Out of the box, Kuma ships with a bundled Envoy data-plane ready to use for our services, so that you don't have to worry about putting all the pieces together.

[Install Kuma](/install) and follow the instructions to get up and running in a few steps.
