# Helm

To install and run Kuma on Kubernetes with Helm charts execute the following steps:

* [1. Add the Kuma charts repository](#1-add-the-kuma-charts-repository)
* [2. Run Kuma](#2-run-kuma)
* [3. Use Kuma](#3-use-kuma)

Finally you can follow the [Quickstart](#4-quickstart) to take it from here and continue your Kuma journey.

Please note that at least version 3.8.0 of Helm is required to use the Kuma Helm charts. If you are using an older version of Helm, please upgrade to version 3.8.0 first.

::: tip
Kuma also provides an alternative [Kubernetes distribution](../installation/kubernetes/) that we can use instead of Helm charts.
:::

###1. Add the Kuma charts repository

To start using Kuma with Helm charts, we first need to add the [Kuma charts repository](https://kumahq.github.io/charts) to our local Helm deployment: 

```sh
helm repo add kuma https://kumahq.github.io/charts
```

Once the repo is added, all following updates can be fetched with `helm repo update`.

###2. Run Kuma

At this point we can install and run Kuma using the following commands. We could use any Kubernetes namespace to install Kuma, by default we suggest using `kuma-system`:

```sh
helm install --create-namespace --namespace kuma-system kuma kuma/kuma
```

This example will run Kuma in `standalone` mode for a "flat" deployment, but there are more advanced [deployment modes](../introduction/deployments.md) like "multi-zone".

###3. Use Kuma

In order to start using Kuma, it's time to check out the [quickstart guide for Kubernetes](../quickstart/kubernetes/) deployments.
