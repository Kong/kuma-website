# Kuma website

This repository contains the source content and tooling for the Kuma website. See also [the source code for Kuma](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma). Kuma provides a control plane for service mesh that supports both Kubernetes and VM environments.

The website is built on [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) and is published with Netlify. It's open-source for the community to contribute to. Feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma-website/issues/new/choose) to propose changes or submit a patch if you want to write some docs! 

[Contact and chat](https://kuma.io/community) with the community in real-time if you get stuck or need clarification. We are here to help.

## Set up local builds with yarn

1.  Install:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

1.  Run:

    ```bash
    yarn docs:dev
    ```

VuePress automatically opens a browser window and displays the local build after it finishes.

You can also run `yarn docs:build` for more complete output with error details if your builds fail.

## Set up local builds with Netlify

If you get errors on the Netlify server, it can help to [set up a local Netlify environment](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/).

It has happened, however, that `yarn docs:dev` AND the local Netlify build succeed, and the build still fails upstream. At which point â€¦ sometimes the logs can help, but not always.

WARNING: when you run a local Netlify build, your local `netlify.toml` is modified. Make sure to revert/discard the changes before you push your local.

## Add generated docs from protobufs

If you create a new policy resource for Kuma, you should rebuild the generated policyref docs.
